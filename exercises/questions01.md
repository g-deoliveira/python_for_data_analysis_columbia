# Test Bank 1

## Topics:
- basic variable assignments
- basic mathematical operations with variables

## Example 1
Define a variable `x` and assign it the value `100`. <br>
Define another variable `y` and assign it the value `-99`. <br>
Use an assert statement to verify that the sum of `x` and `y` is 1. <br>

```python
# Example 1000
x = 100
y = -99
assert x + y == 1
```

## Question 1
Define a variable `cat_count` and assign it the value `30`. <br>
Define a variable `dog_count` and assign it the value `23`. <br>
Define a variable `bird_count` and assign it the value `9`. <br>
Define a variable `fish_count` and assign it the value `8`. <br>

Compute the sum of the cats, dogs, birds and fish and assign it to the variable `pets`.
Assert that `pets` has value `70`.

## Question 2


## Example 10
Define a variable `x` and assign it the value `5`. <br>
Define a variable `y` and assign it the value `-6`. <br>
Use an assert statement to verify that the product of `x` and `y` is `-30`. <br>

```python
# Example 1020
x = 5
y = -6
assert x * y == -30
```

## Question 1030
Define a variable `x` and assign it the value `5`. <br>
Define a variable `y` and assign it the value of `x` cubed. <br>
Use an assert statement to verify that `y` has value `125`. <br>
**Note:** in this calculation, use only multiplication. <br>

## Example 1031
Define a variable `hours` and assign it the value `5`. <br>
Define a variable `minutes` and assign it the value of `hours`, converted to minutes. <br>
Use an assert statement to verify that `minutes` has value `300`. <br>

```python
# Example 1031
hours = 5
minutes = hours * 60
assert minutes == 300
```

## Question 1032
Define a variable `hours` and assign it the value `5`. <br>
Define a variable `minutes` and assign it the value `24`. <br>
Define a variable `seconds` and assign it to the time (hours and minutes) converted to seconds. <br>
Use an assert statement to verify that `seconds` has value `19440`. <br>

## Example 1040
There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute. <br>
If the current time is 2 AM, compute the number of minutes that have elapsed today. <br>
Define all variables using meaningful names and write down some code that computes this quantity in a legible manner. <br>
Calculate the answer independently and use it in an assert statement to demonstrate that your python code is correct. <br>

``` python
# Example 1040
current_time = 2
minutes_per_hour = 60
number_of_elapsed_minutes = current_time * minutes_per_hour
assert number_of_elapsed_minutes == 120
```

## Question 1041
If the current time is 2 AM, compute the number of **_seconds_** that have elapsed today. <br>
Define all variables using meaningful names and write down some code that computes this quantity in a legible manner. <br>
Calculate the answer independently and use it in an assert statement to demonstrate that your python code is correct. <br>

## Question 1042
If the current time is 2:32 AM, (that is 32 minutes past 2 AM), compute the number of **_seconds_** that have elapsed today. <br>
Define all variables using meaningful names and write down some code that computes this quantity in a legible manner. <br>
Calculate the answer independently and use it in an assert statement to demonstrate that your python code is correct. <br>

## Question 1043
There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute. <br>
If the current time is 2 AM, compute the number of hours that remain until midnight. <br>
Define all variables using meaningful names and write down some code that computes this quantity in a legible manner. <br>
Calculate the answer independently and use it in an assert statement to demonstrate that your python code is correct. <br>

## Question 1044
